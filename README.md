# Prefix to infix notation in Scheme 

This is a continuation of the [symbolic-differentiator](https://github.com/muffpy/symbolic-differentiator) repo. Scheme uses **paranthesized prefix notation** to evaluate expressions (like much of the members in the Lisp family of dialects.) In this repo, we convert the notation to **infix form**.
